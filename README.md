#Abstract
The purpose of this project is to design a higher fidelity physical simulation training model for suturing of blood vessels, specifically in the case of a uterine  artery laceration. The main improvements introduced to this model include a pump to simulate continuous blood flow. An additional goal of this project is to implement cheap, easily replaceable parts in the model that allow for greater continued use of the training model. Toaccomplish this, some compromises were made with the chosen tubing that sacrificed realistic properties for price and availability. The intention of the final product is to better trainsurgeons to improve overall performance and success rate when transferring the skills gained from simulation to actual surgery.


#Materials and Methods

We created a pumping physical simulation training model for suturing of blood vessels to mimic surgery in a laboratory experiment.  A pond submersible pump was fit to latex tubing with a pressure gauge in line.  The pressure gauge allowed us to set the pump to a specific pressure of 120 mmHg similar to systolic blood pressure.  Subsequently the surgeon made an x cm incision in the tubing and collected the amount of fluid spill from the incision in a basin.  The tared weight of the fluid was collected for both locking and non-locking methods of closure to estimate blood loss.  The method of incision closure was randomized by a random number generator.  Each incision was closed with a standard x number of sutures with an assistant providing the same traction.  

We considered 50 milliliters of blood loss to be clinically significant and therefore powered the experiment for that amount.
